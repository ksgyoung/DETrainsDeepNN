# DETrainsDeepNN


This is a personal project aiming to create a Differential Evolution algorithm to train a deep neural network.

It begins by first creating a normal differential evolution algorithm and then later on adapting it to train a NN and deep NN.

The project is being completed folllowing TDD practices.
